  - The actual Firefox profile is created on the first Firefox start.
  - The non-root **VNC user** got permissions to modify the **user.js** file and the whole profile.
  - The backup copy **user.js.txt** is in the folder **/headless/.mozilla/firefox**, so the default profile can be safely deleted.
